# GDP - Life Expectancy Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and life expectancy data for six different countries. The project aims to explore the relationship between a country's economic prosperity (GDP) and the life expectancy of its residents. By analyzing this data, we can gain insights into the quality of life, healthcare, and economic conditions in each of these countries.

## Key Feature

* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and patterns of GDP and life expectancy.
* Visualization of trends and relationships between GDP and life expectancy.
